/*
A constructor is a special member function automatically called when an object is created. In C++, the constructor is automatically called when an object is created. It is a special class method because it does not have any return type. It has the same name as the class itself.

A constructor initializes the class data members with garbage value if we donâ€™t put any value to it explicitly.

 The constructor must be placed in the public section of the class because we want the class to be instantiated anywhere. For every object in its lifetime constructor is called only once at the time of creation.
